# Association between access to internet and Health Insurance demand
## Rationale
Access to quality healthcare is crucial for any individual but however, poor Indian households struggle to pay for their unpredictable health expenses in an increasingly costly healthcare climate in India. Hence, individuals are encouraged to subscribe for health insurances to cover for unexpected exorbitant medical expenses without much burden on their out-of-pocket. However, it is of paramount importance to understand the determinants of health insurance acquisition to better build health insurance products specific to individuals across rural/urban areas,age sex,caste and income sub-groups. The effect of socioeconomic and demographic variables on health insurance demand is well-studied but however, there is lack of literature which empirically ascertains the effect of access to internet devices on health insurance demand

## Objective
This study attempts to explore the effect of access to digital devices on health insurance demand across rural and urban areas in India, using the Indian Human Development Survey-II, 2011-2012 dataset. This study aims to contribute towards insurance policy making in a digitalized world by empirically determining the impact of consumer access to internet devices on health insurance demand amongst several other demographic, socio-economic and psychosocial variables, and ultimately, contribute towards achieving Universal health coverage.

## Skillsets deployed
- STATA Programming
- Advanced Econometrics
- Descriptive Statistics
- Exploratory data analysis
- Probit regression
- Predictive modelling
- Model specification and Diagnostic checks
- Research paper writing

## Results
This study found that access to Internet is positively associated with Health Insurance uptake and the Probit marginal effects at mean estimates suggest that access to Internet increases the likelihood of Insurance uptake by about 1.4% both in rural and urban areas and Interestingly, confidence factor in governments is positively associated with Health Insurance uptake.
